# DTcolorTag
I didnâ€™t find a way to let tags in Devonthink inherit the color of its "parent tag" (when the tag is a [nested tag](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/nested-tags-in-mac-os-finder/67712)) so [I wrote this](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/color-tags-with-javascript/69630) to be used as a as an external script or as a part of a smart rule.<br/>
Command to run from terminal: `osascript -l JavaScript colorTag.js `
