# DTcolorTag
As I havenâ€™t found a way to let tags inherit the color of its "parent tag" (when the tag is a [nested tag](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/nested-tags-in-mac-os-finder/67712)).<br/>
Can be used as external script or as a part of a smart rule.<br/>
Command to run from terminal: `osascript -l JavaScript colorTag.js `
